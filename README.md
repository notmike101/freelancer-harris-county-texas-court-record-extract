# Harris County Texas Court Record Extract
For unpaid freelancer project

## Project Description

I would like someone to scrape all eviction filings from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2018 from this website: https://jpwebsite.harriscountytx.gov/PublicExtracts/search.jsp

This is the search criteria:
- Extract Type: Civil
- Extract to Request: Cases Entered
- Case types to include: Eviction

The data must include filings from every court and precinct, from January 1, 2000 up to and including December 31, 2018. I will need to view a sample of work to ensure 100% accuracy before committing. I am most likely to accept a bid for under $150 and within 1 day.
